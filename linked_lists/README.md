# Linked List

Q: What is Linked List?
A: A linked list is a data structure that represents a sequence of elements, where each element is linked to the next one using a pointer or reference. Unlike an array, which stores elements in contiguous memory locations, the elements in a linked list can be scattered across memory, with each element pointing to the next one in the list.
